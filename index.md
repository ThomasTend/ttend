I am a PhD student at the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Mathematics of Random Systems](https://www.randomsystems-cdt.ac.uk) at the University of Oxford. I have a broad interest in probability theory and related partial differential equations. My advisor is [Julien Berestycki](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~berestyc/).

Before coming to Oxford, I completed a B.A. and M.A. in mathematics at McGill University. For my master's degree, I worked under the supervision of [Louigi Addario-Berry](http://problab.ca/louigi/) and [Jessica Lin](https://sites.google.com/view/jessicalin-math/home).
